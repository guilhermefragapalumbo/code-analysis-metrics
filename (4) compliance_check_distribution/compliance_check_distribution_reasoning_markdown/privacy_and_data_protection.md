| Task Name | Compliance Check | Reasoning |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Data Collection | Raw Data Acquisition | Ensuring privacy and data protection starts with the initial data collection process. Raw data acquisition should be done in a manner that respects user privacy and complies with data protection regulations. This includes obtaining informed consent from users and ensuring that the data collected is necessary and proportionate to the intended purpose. |
| Data Extraction | Data Retrieval Implementation | Data extraction involves retrieving data from various sources. It is crucial to ensure that data retrieval processes are in line with privacy and data protection standards. This includes ensuring that data is retrieved in a secure manner and that any sensitive data is appropriately protected. |
| Data Integration | Multi-Source Data Merging | When integrating data from multiple sources, it is important to ensure that privacy and data protection principles are upheld. This includes ensuring that the merging of data does not result in the identification of individuals or the disclosure of sensitive information. |
| Data Storage Strategy | Storage Selection and Implementation | The way data is stored can have significant implications for privacy and data protection. The storage solution should ensure the security of the data, prevent unauthorized access, and allow for the effective management of data in line with data protection principles. |
| Anonymization and Privacy Handling | Sensitive Data Masking | Anonymization and privacy handling are directly related to privacy and data protection. Sensitive data masking is a technique used to ensure that personal data is anonymized in a way that prevents the identification of individuals. This is a key requirement of data protection regulations. |
| Security Measures | Authentication & Encryption Checks | Security measures such as authentication and encryption are crucial for ensuring privacy and data protection. Authentication prevents unauthorized access to data, while encryption ensures that data is unreadable to anyone who does not have the decryption key. |
| Data Quality Checks | Consistency and Integrity Checks | Data quality checks, including consistency and integrity checks, are important for ensuring that the data used and generated by the AI system is reliable and accurate. This is crucial for upholding privacy and data protection principles as inaccurate data can lead to incorrect inferences about individuals and potentially discriminatory outcomes. |
| Incident Response Planning | Model Failure & Security Handling | Incident response planning is crucial for ensuring privacy and data protection. In the event of a security breach or model failure, a well-planned response can help to minimize the impact on individuals' privacy and ensure that data protection obligations are met. |
| Logging and Debugging | Prediction & Failure Logging | Logging and debugging processes can help to identify and rectify issues that may impact privacy and data protection. For example, prediction and failure logging can help to identify instances where the AI system is making incorrect inferences about individuals, which could potentially lead to discriminatory outcomes. |
