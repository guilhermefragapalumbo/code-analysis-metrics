| Task Name | Compliance Check | Reasoning |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Interpretability Analysis | Model Explainability Implementation | This task directly supports the principle of communication as it involves making the AI system understandable to its users. By implementing model explainability, users can understand the AI system's capabilities and limitations, which is a key aspect of the communication principle. |
| Explainability Features | Model Interpretability Tools | This task aligns with the communication principle by providing tools that make the AI system's operations transparent to users. This supports the requirement of communicating the AI system's level of accuracy and limitations. |
| Performance Metric Calculation | Evaluation Metric Computation | This task supports the communication principle by providing quantifiable measures of the AI system's performance. This allows for clear communication of the system's capabilities and limitations to AI practitioners or end-users. |
| Uncertainty Estimation | Confidence & Uncertainty Measures | This task supports the communication principle by providing measures of the AI system's confidence and uncertainty. This information can be communicated to users to help them understand the system's limitations and reliability. |
| Bias and Fairness Testing | Bias Detection & Mitigation | This task aligns with the communication principle by identifying and mitigating biases in the AI system. Communicating these efforts to users can help build trust and ensure that users are aware of the system's limitations and the steps taken to address them. |
| API Integration | Model API Development | This task supports the communication principle by providing a clear interface for interacting with the AI system. This can help users understand how to use the system and what to expect from it. |
| Logging and Debugging | Prediction & Failure Logging | This task supports the communication principle by logging predictions and failures. This information can be communicated to users to help them understand the system's performance and limitations. |
