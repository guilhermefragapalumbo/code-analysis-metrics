| Security Measures                  | Authentication & Encryption Checks   | Ensure the code implements authentication, authorization, and encryption for model security.                                                     |
| Infrastructure Setup               | Deployment Platform Selection        | Verify if the code specifies the deployment platform (on-premises, cloud, or edge devices).                                                      |
| Containerization                   | Containerized Model Deployment       | Check if the code includes Docker or Kubernetes for deploying the model in a containerized environment.                                          |
| Data Storage Strategy              | Storage Selection and Implementation | Evaluate whether the code correctly implements storage solutions, such as data lakes, warehouses, or distributed systems, based on requirements. |
| Anonymization and Privacy Handling | Sensitive Data Masking               | Check if the code masks or anonymizes sensitive data while preserving analytical utility.                                                        |
| Incident Response Planning         | Model Failure & Security Handling    | Verify if the code includes strategies for handling failures, security threats, or biases.                                                       |
| Logging and Debugging              | Prediction & Failure Logging         | Ensure the code maintains logs of predictions, failures, and user feedback for debugging.                                                        |
