| Bias and Fairness Testing          | Bias Detection & Mitigation          | Assess whether the code includes techniques to detect and mitigate model biases against specific groups. |
| Interpretability Analysis          | Model Explainability Implementation  | Verify if the code uses SHAP, LIME, or feature importance scores to explain model predictions.           |
| Anonymization and Privacy Handling | Sensitive Data Masking               | Check if the code masks or anonymizes sensitive data while preserving analytical utility.                |
| Security Measures                  | Authentication & Encryption Checks   | Ensure the code implements authentication, authorization, and encryption for model security.             |
| Incident Response Planning         | Model Failure & Security Handling    | Verify if the code includes strategies for handling failures, security threats, or biases.               |
| Data Drift Detection               | Input Data Distribution Monitoring   | Check if the code includes mechanisms to track shifts in input data distribution.                        |
| Concept Drift Detection            | Target Relationship Change Detection | Ensure the code monitors changes in the relationship between input features and target labels.           |
