| Task Name            | Compliance Check                   | Compliance description                                                                                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection      | Raw Data Acquisition               | Check if the code includes methods to collect raw data from databases, APIs, sensors, web scraping, or user inputs.                   |
| Data Extraction      | Data Retrieval Implementation      | Verify if the code includes logic to extract data from structured (CSV, SQL databases) and unstructured (PDFs, images, text) sources. |
| Data Integration     | Multi-Source Data Merging          | Assess whether the code includes functionality to merge multiple data sources while resolving inconsistencies.                        |
| Data Labeling        | Annotation Mechanism               | Assess if the code includes an annotation system for supervised learning tasks, such as manual or automated labeling.                 |
| Metadata Management  | Metadata Storage and Tracking      | Verify if the code maintains structured metadata, including source details, timestamps, and schema definitions.                       |
| Data Versioning      | Version Control Implementation     | Ensure that the code implements dataset versioning to track different versions for reproducibility and rollback capabilities.         |
| Schema Validation    | Schema Conformance Check           | Check if the code validates incoming data against predefined formats and structures to ensure compliance.                             |
| Data Quality Checks  | Consistency and Integrity Checks   | Assess whether the code includes checks to maintain data quality and consistency throughout preprocessing.                            |
| Data Drift Detection | Input Data Distribution Monitoring | Check if the code includes mechanisms to track shifts in input data distribution.                                                     |
| Anomaly Detection    | Unexpected Prediction Flagging     | Check if the code includes mechanisms to detect and flag unexpected predictions.                                                      |
