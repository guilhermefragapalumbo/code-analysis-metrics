  {
    "Task Name": "Bias and Fairness Testing",
    "Compliance Check": "Bias Detection & Mitigation",
    "Reasoning": "This task directly supports the principle of human agency and oversight by ensuring that the AI system does not unfairly favor or disadvantage certain groups of users. By detecting and mitigating bias, we ensure that the AI system respects human autonomy and fosters fundamental rights."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Interpretability Analysis",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Explainability Implementation",
    "Reasoning": "Interpretability is crucial for human oversight of AI systems. By implementing model explainability, we can ensure that the decision-making process of the AI system is transparent and understandable to humans, thereby supporting human agency."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Anomaly Detection",
    "Compliance Check": "Unexpected Prediction Flagging",
    "Reasoning": "Anomaly detection supports human oversight by flagging unexpected predictions. This allows humans to intervene when the AI system behaves in unexpected ways, thereby supporting the principle of respect for human autonomy."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Incident Response Planning",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Failure & Security Handling",
    "Reasoning": "Incident response planning ensures that there are procedures in place for human intervention in case of model failure or security issues. This supports human oversight and the principle of respect for human autonomy."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Explainability Features",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Interpretability Tools",
    "Reasoning": "The inclusion of explainability features in an AI system is a direct operationalization of the principle of human agency and oversight. These features allow users to understand the decision-making process of the AI system, thereby supporting human autonomy and fostering fundamental rights."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Model Retraining Scheduling",
    "Compliance Check": "Automated Model Retraining Pipeline",
    "Reasoning": "Model retraining scheduling allows for human oversight by ensuring that the AI system's performance remains consistent over time. This supports the principle of respect for human autonomy by allowing humans to intervene and retrain the model when necessary."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Logging and Debugging",
    "Compliance Check": "Prediction & Failure Logging",
    "Reasoning": "Logging and debugging support human oversight by keeping a record of the AI system's predictions and failures. This allows humans to review the system's performance and intervene when necessary, thereby supporting the principle of respect for human autonomy."
