  {
    "Task Name": "Data Extraction",
    "Compliance Check": "Data Retrieval Implementation",
    "Reasoning": "Data extraction involves retrieving data from various sources. It is important to ensure that this process is done in a manner that respects privacy and adheres to data governance protocols. This includes ensuring that data is only accessed from sources that have given consent and that the data is handled securely."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Data Integration",
    "Compliance Check": "Multi-Source Data Merging",
    "Reasoning": "When integrating data from multiple sources, it is important to ensure that privacy is maintained and that data governance protocols are followed. This includes ensuring that the data is merged in a manner that does not compromise privacy or the integrity of the data."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Metadata Management",
    "Compliance Check": "Metadata Storage and Tracking",
    "Reasoning": "Metadata management involves storing and tracking information about the data. This is crucial for privacy and data governance as it allows for the tracking of data lineage and ensures that data is handled in a manner that respects privacy and adheres to data governance protocols."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Data Versioning",
    "Compliance Check": "Version Control Implementation",
    "Reasoning": "Data versioning involves keeping track of different versions of the data. This is important for privacy and data governance as it allows for the tracking of changes to the data and ensures that any changes made respect privacy and adhere to data governance protocols."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Data Storage Strategy",
    "Compliance Check": "Storage Selection and Implementation",
    "Reasoning": "The way data is stored can have a significant impact on privacy and data governance. It is important to select storage solutions that prioritize security and privacy, and to implement them in a way that aligns with data governance protocols."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Anonymization and Privacy Handling",
    "Compliance Check": "Sensitive Data Masking",
    "Reasoning": "Anonymization and privacy handling are directly related to the principle of privacy and data governance. Sensitive data masking is a technique used to ensure that personally identifiable information is not exposed, thereby protecting the privacy of individuals."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Data Quality Checks",
    "Compliance Check": "Consistency and Integrity Checks",
    "Reasoning": "Data quality checks, including consistency and integrity checks, are crucial for maintaining the quality and integrity of the data used in AI systems. This aligns with the principle of privacy and data governance, which emphasizes the importance of data quality and integrity."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Security Measures",
    "Compliance Check": "Authentication & Encryption Checks",
    "Reasoning": "Security measures, including authentication and encryption checks, are crucial for protecting the privacy of data and ensuring that data governance protocols are adhered to. These measures help prevent unauthorized access to data and protect the integrity of the data."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Data Drift Detection",
    "Compliance Check": "Input Data Distribution Monitoring",
    "Reasoning": "Data drift detection involves monitoring the distribution of input data. This is important for privacy and data governance as it allows for the detection of changes in the data that could potentially compromise privacy or violate data governance protocols."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Logging and Debugging",
    "Compliance Check": "Prediction & Failure Logging",
    "Reasoning": "Logging and debugging, including prediction and failure logging, are important for maintaining the integrity of the data and ensuring that privacy is respected. By keeping track of predictions and failures, it is possible to identify and address issues that could compromise privacy or violate data governance protocols."
