| Data Collection                    | Raw Data Acquisition                 | Check if the code includes methods to collect raw data from databases, APIs, sensors, web scraping, or user inputs.   |
| Data Labeling                      | Annotation Mechanism                 | Assess if the code includes an annotation system for supervised learning tasks, such as manual or automated labeling. |
| Handling Imbalanced Data           | Class Balance Techniques             | Ensure the code implements oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation (e.g., SMOTE).                   |
| Bias and Fairness Testing          | Bias Detection & Mitigation          | Assess whether the code includes techniques to detect and mitigate model biases against specific groups.              |
| Data Quality Checks                | Consistency and Integrity Checks     | Assess whether the code includes checks to maintain data quality and consistency throughout preprocessing.            |
| Anonymization and Privacy Handling | Sensitive Data Masking               | Check if the code masks or anonymizes sensitive data while preserving analytical utility.                             |
| Data Drift Detection               | Input Data Distribution Monitoring   | Check if the code includes mechanisms to track shifts in input data distribution.                                     |
| Concept Drift Detection            | Target Relationship Change Detection | Ensure the code monitors changes in the relationship between input features and target labels.                        |
| Handling Class Imbalances          | Balanced Training Strategy           | Verify if the code adjusts class weights or applies cost-sensitive learning methods.                                  |
