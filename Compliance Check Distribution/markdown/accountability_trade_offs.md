| Bias and Fairness Testing         | Bias Detection & Mitigation      | Assess whether the code includes techniques to detect and mitigate model biases against specific groups.|
| Interpretability Analysis         | Model Explainability Implementation | Verify if the code uses SHAP, LIME, or feature importance scores to explain model predictions.           |
| Model Selection                  | Algorithm Choice Implementation | Check if the code includes logic to select the best algorithm (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, transformers) for the task.|
| Defining Loss Functions and Optimizers | Loss Function & Optimizer Selection | Verify if the code properly defines loss functions (e.g., MSE, cross-entropy) and optimization methods (SGD, Adam).|
| Hyperparameter Optimization       | Automated Hyperparameter Tuning | Verify if the code implements grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization for fine-tuning.     |
| Performance Monitoring            | Model Performance Metric Tracking | Verify if the code logs key metrics like accuracy, latency, and throughput in production.                |
| Data Drift Detection              | Input Data Distribution Monitoring | Check if the code includes mechanisms to track shifts in input data distribution.                        |
| Incident Response Planning        | Model Failure & Security Handling | Verify if the code includes strategies for handling failures, security threats, or biases.               |
