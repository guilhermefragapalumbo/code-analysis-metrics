| Task Name | Compliance Check | Compliance Description |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Bias and Fairness Testing | Bias Detection & Mitigation | Assess whether the code includes techniques to detect and mitigate model biases against specific groups. |
| Error Analysis | Incorrect Prediction Analysis | Check if the code identifies patterns in incorrect predictions and provides insights for improvement. |
| Incident Response Planning | Model Failure & Security Handling | Verify if the code includes strategies for handling failures, security threats, or biases. |
| Anomaly Detection | Unexpected Prediction Flagging | Check if the code includes mechanisms to detect and flag unexpected predictions. |
| Performance Monitoring | Model Performance Metric Tracking | Verify if the code logs key metrics like accuracy, latency, and throughput in production. |
| Data Drift Detection | Input Data Distribution Monitoring | Check if the code includes mechanisms to track shifts in input data distribution. |
| Concept Drift Detection | Target Relationship Change Detection | Ensure the code monitors changes in the relationship between input features and target labels. |
| Logging and Debugging | Prediction & Failure Logging | Ensure the code maintains logs of predictions, failures, and user feedback for debugging. |
