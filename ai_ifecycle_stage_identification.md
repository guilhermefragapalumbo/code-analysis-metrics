Seven stages were identified that capture the end-to-end lifecycle of AI system development:– Data Ingestion and Versioning: Collection and management of raw data, integrating it from various systems, and applying appropriate version control ensuring data traceability and reproducibility.– Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for training. Tasks may include outlier removal, feature encoding, and handling missing values.– Model Training and Tuning: Learning algorithms are applied to data, and models are developed and trained. Tasks include hyperparameter optimization, regularization, and validation splits.– Model Evaluation: Validating model performance using appropriate metrics.– Model Versioning: As models are updated and retrained, versioning ensures changes are tracked and documented, documenting and managing different model versions.– Model Deployment: Integrating the model into production environments.This may involve wrapping models in APIs, ensuring infrastructure compatibility, and conducting deployment testing.– Monitoring and Maintenance: Ongoing observation and updates to the model post-deployment.
