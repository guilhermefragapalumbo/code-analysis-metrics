| Metadata Management | Metadata Storage and Tracking | Metadata management directly supports auditability by providing a clear, structured record of the data used in an AI system. This allows auditors to understand the sources, types, and characteristics of the data, which is crucial for assessing the fairness, accuracy, and reliability of the system. |
| Data Versioning | Version Control Implementation | Data versioning is essential for auditability as it allows for the tracking of changes made to the data over time. This is crucial for understanding how the AI system's performance and behavior may have been influenced by changes in the data. |
| Schema Validation | Schema Conformance Check | Schema validation ensures that the data adheres to a predefined schema, which is important for auditability. This allows auditors to understand the structure and format of the data, and to check that the data has been processed and used correctly. |
| Data Quality Checks | Consistency and Integrity Checks | Data quality checks are key to auditability as they ensure the integrity and consistency of the data. This allows auditors to assess the quality of the data and to understand any potential issues or biases that may affect the AI system's performance. |
| Performance Metric Calculation | Evaluation Metric Computation | The calculation of performance metrics allows auditors to assess the effectiveness and accuracy of the AI system. This is crucial for auditability as it provides a quantitative measure of the system's performance. |
| Bias and Fairness Testing | Bias Detection & Mitigation | Bias and fairness testing is crucial for auditability as it allows auditors to assess whether the AI system is treating all individuals and groups fairly. This is key for ensuring that the system is not perpetuating or exacerbating existing biases. |
| Interpretability Analysis | Model Explainability Implementation | Interpretability analysis is key for auditability as it allows auditors to understand how the AI system makes its decisions. This is crucial for assessing the fairness and reliability of the system, and for identifying any potential issues or biases. |
| Model Validation | Validation Set Performance Check | Model validation is important for auditability as it allows auditors to assess how well the AI system generalizes to unseen data. This is crucial for understanding the system's robustness and reliability. |
| Experiment Tracking | Hyperparameter & Metric Logging | Experiment tracking supports auditability by providing a record of the different configurations and performance metrics of the AI system. This allows auditors to understand how the system has been optimized and to assess the robustness of the optimization process. |
| Model Registry Management | Version-Controlled Model Storage | Model registry management supports auditability by providing a record of the different versions of the AI model. This allows auditors to understand how the model has evolved over time and to assess the impact of different versions on the system's performance. |
| Performance Monitoring | Model Performance Metric Tracking | Performance monitoring is key for auditability as it provides a continuous record of the AI system's performance. This allows auditors to assess the system's reliability and stability over time. |
| Data Drift Detection | Input Data Distribution Monitoring | Data drift detection supports auditability by monitoring changes in the distribution of the input data. This allows auditors to understand how changes in the data may have affected the AI system's performance. |
| Logging and Debugging | Prediction & Failure Logging | Logging and debugging are crucial for auditability as they provide a record of the AI system's predictions and failures. This allows auditors to understand the system's behavior and to identify any potential issues or errors. |
