| Data Collection | Raw Data Acquisition | Transparency in AI requires that the origins and nature of the data used in the system are clear. Raw data acquisition is the first step in this process, and ensuring its transparency is crucial for the overall transparency of the AI system. |
| Metadata Management | Metadata Storage and Tracking | Metadata provides information about the data used in an AI system. Transparent storage and tracking of metadata allows stakeholders to understand the characteristics of the data, including its source, type, and collection methods, which contributes to the overall transparency of the AI system. |
| Data Versioning | Version Control Implementation | Version control provides a transparent history of changes to the data over time. This allows stakeholders to understand how the data has evolved, which is important for replicability and accountability in AI systems. |
| Anonymization and Privacy Handling | Sensitive Data Masking | Transparent handling of anonymization and privacy is crucial to ensure that sensitive data is protected. This includes clearly communicating how personal data is anonymized and what measures are in place to protect privacy. |
| Data Quality Checks | Consistency and Integrity Checks | Transparency in AI requires that the quality of the data used in the system is clear. Consistency and integrity checks ensure that the data is reliable and accurate, which contributes to the overall transparency of the AI system. |
| Infrastructure Setup | Deployment Platform Selection | Transparency in AI also extends to the infrastructure used to deploy the AI system. The choice of deployment platform can impact the performance and behavior of the AI system, and should therefore be transparently communicated. |
| Interpretability Analysis | Model Explainability Implementation | Interpretability is a key aspect of transparency in AI. It involves making the workings of the AI system understandable to stakeholders. Implementing model explainability techniques helps to achieve this by making the decision-making process of the AI system transparent. |
| Model Validation | Validation Set Performance Check | Transparency in AI requires that the performance of the AI system is clear. Checking the performance of the AI system on a validation set provides a transparent measure of how well the system is likely to perform on unseen data. |
| Model Hashing | Unique Model Identifier Generation | Model hashing and the generation of unique model identifiers contribute to transparency by providing a clear and unambiguous way to reference specific versions of the AI system. This is important for tracking changes and maintaining accountability. |
| Performance Monitoring | Model Performance Metric Tracking | Transparent performance monitoring is crucial to ensure that stakeholders have a clear understanding of how the AI system is performing over time. This includes tracking key performance metrics and communicating them in a transparent manner. |
