| Infrastructure Setup | Deployment Platform Selection | The choice of deployment platform can have significant implications for the environmental impact of an AI system. Platforms that prioritize energy efficiency and use renewable energy sources can significantly reduce the environmental footprint of the AI system. |
| Containerization | Containerized Model Deployment | Containerization can improve resource efficiency by allowing multiple applications to share the same OS, reducing the overall energy consumption and hardware requirements. This supports the principle of sustainable and environmentally friendly AI. |
| Scalability Planning | Load Balancing & Autoscaling | Effective scalability planning, including load balancing and autoscaling, can optimize resource usage and reduce unnecessary energy consumption. By dynamically adjusting resources based on demand, we can minimize waste and align with the principle of environmentally friendly AI. |
| Data Pipeline Optimization | Training Data Pipeline Efficiency | Optimizing the data pipeline can reduce the computational resources required for training, which in turn reduces energy consumption. This aligns with the principle of sustainable and environmentally friendly AI by minimizing the environmental impact of the AI system's development process. |
| Parallelization and Distributed Training | Scalable Training Implementation | Parallelization and distributed training can improve the efficiency of the training process, reducing the time and energy required. This supports the principle of sustainable and environmentally friendly AI by minimizing the energy consumption during the AI system's development. |
| Resource Monitoring | System Resource Usage Tracking | Monitoring system resource usage can help identify inefficiencies and opportunities for optimization. By reducing unnecessary resource usage, we can minimize the environmental impact of the AI system, supporting the principle of sustainable and environmentally friendly AI. |
