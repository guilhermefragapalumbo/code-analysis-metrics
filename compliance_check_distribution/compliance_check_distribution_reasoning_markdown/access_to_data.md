| Data Collection | Raw Data Acquisition | The process of raw data acquisition is directly related to the principle of access to data as it involves the initial stage of data access. Ensuring ethical alignment at this stage is crucial as it sets the tone for subsequent data handling processes. The access to data should be limited to qualified personnel, and data acquisition should be conducted in a manner that respects the rights and privacy of individuals. |
| Data Extraction | Data Retrieval Implementation | Data retrieval is a process that involves accessing stored data. Implementing ethical guidelines in this process ensures that only authorized personnel can access the data, thereby aligning with the principle of access to data. |
| Data Integration | Multi-Source Data Merging | The process of merging data from multiple sources involves accessing data from different locations. Implementing ethical guidelines in this process ensures that the access to data from different sources is controlled and limited to authorized personnel. |
| Data Storage Strategy | Storage Selection and Implementation | The storage selection and implementation process is directly related to the principle of access to data. The chosen storage solution should have robust access control mechanisms in place to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the data. |
| Anonymization and Privacy Handling | Sensitive Data Masking | Sensitive data masking is a process that helps protect individuals' privacy by ensuring that sensitive data is not accessible to unauthorized personnel. This process aligns with the principle of access to data by controlling who can access sensitive information. |
| Security Measures | Authentication & Encryption Checks | Authentication and encryption checks are crucial for controlling access to data. Authentication ensures that only authorized personnel can access the data, while encryption protects the data from unauthorized access during transmission. Both of these checks align with the principle of access to data. |
| Incident Response Planning | Model Failure & Security Handling | Incident response planning involves preparing for potential security incidents, including unauthorized access to data. By having a plan in place for handling such incidents, organizations can ensure that they are prepared to respond effectively and limit the impact of any unauthorized access to data. |
