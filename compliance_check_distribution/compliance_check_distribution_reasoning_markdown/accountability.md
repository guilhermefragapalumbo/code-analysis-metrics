| Task Name | Compliance Check | Reasoning |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Experiment Tracking | Hyperparameter & Metric Logging | Accountability in AI development requires traceability of decisions made during the development process. Experiment tracking, specifically the logging of hyperparameters and metrics, provides a record of the different configurations tested and their outcomes, allowing for transparency and reproducibility, which are key aspects of accountability. |
| Model Registry Management | Version-Controlled Model Storage | Accountability requires the ability to trace back the versions of the AI models used. Having a version-controlled model storage allows for tracking of changes and improvements made to the model over time, which supports accountability by ensuring that each version of the model and its performance can be audited. |
| Performance Monitoring | Model Performance Metric Tracking | Monitoring the performance of an AI system is crucial for accountability. By tracking model performance metrics, developers can ensure that the system is performing as expected and can be held accountable for any deviations from expected performance. |
| Data Drift Detection | Input Data Distribution Monitoring | Accountability requires vigilance in monitoring the input data distribution. Changes in the data distribution could lead to changes in the model performance, and detecting such changes is crucial for maintaining accountability for the system's outcomes. |
| Incident Response Planning | Model Failure & Security Handling | Accountability requires planning for potential failures and security issues. Having a plan in place for responding to incidents ensures that responsibility is clearly defined and that actions can be taken quickly to mitigate any negative impacts. |
| Logging and Debugging | Prediction & Failure Logging | Logging predictions and failures is a key aspect of accountability. This allows for a clear record of the system's performance and any issues that arise, which can be used to hold the developers accountable for the system's outcomes. |
| Bias and Fairness Testing | Bias Detection & Mitigation | Accountability includes being responsible for the fairness of the AI system. By testing for bias and implementing mitigation strategies, developers demonstrate accountability for ensuring that the system treats all individuals and groups fairly. |
| Interpretability Analysis | Model Explainability Implementation | Accountability necessitates that the workings of an AI system can be understood and explained. Implementing model explainability supports accountability by allowing developers, users, and regulators to understand how the system makes its decisions. |
