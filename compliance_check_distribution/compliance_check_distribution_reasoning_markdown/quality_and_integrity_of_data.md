| Task Name | Compliance Check | Reasoning |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Data Collection | Raw Data Acquisition | The quality and integrity of data starts from the point of collection. Ensuring that raw data is accurately and ethically acquired is fundamental to the performance of AI systems. This task directly supports the principle by ensuring that the initial data used is of high quality and integrity. |
| Data Extraction | Data Retrieval Implementation | Data extraction is a critical process in maintaining data quality and integrity. The method of retrieving data can significantly impact its quality, hence, a well-implemented data retrieval process ensures that the extracted data maintains its original quality and integrity. |
| Data Integration | Multi-Source Data Merging | Data integration involves merging data from multiple sources. This task is directly related to the principle as it ensures that the merging process does not compromise the quality and integrity of the data, which could otherwise lead to biases and inaccuracies in the AI system. |
| Data Labeling | Annotation Mechanism | Data labeling directly affects the quality of data as it involves assigning meaningful information to raw data. An effective annotation mechanism ensures that the labels accurately represent the data, thus maintaining its quality and integrity. |
| Metadata Management | Metadata Storage and Tracking | Metadata management is crucial for maintaining data quality and integrity. Proper storage and tracking of metadata allows for better understanding and control over the data, ensuring its quality and integrity are preserved. |
| Data Versioning | Version Control Implementation | Data versioning allows for tracking changes in the data over time. Implementing version control ensures that the quality and integrity of the data are maintained across different versions, preventing potential issues related to data corruption or loss. |
| Schema Validation | Schema Conformance Check | Schema validation ensures that the data adheres to a specific structure or format. Checking for schema conformance ensures that the data maintains its quality and integrity by preventing potential issues related to data inconsistency or incompatibility. |
| Data Quality Checks | Consistency and Integrity Checks | Data quality checks are directly related to the principle as they ensure the data's consistency and integrity. Regular checks can identify and rectify any inconsistencies or integrity issues, thereby maintaining the overall quality of the data. |
| Data Drift Detection | Input Data Distribution Monitoring | Data drift detection monitors changes in the input data distribution over time. This task supports the principle by ensuring that the quality and integrity of the data are maintained despite potential changes in the data distribution. |
| Anomaly Detection | Unexpected Prediction Flagging | Anomaly detection helps identify data points that deviate significantly from the norm. By flagging unexpected predictions, this task supports the principle by ensuring that anomalies, which could potentially compromise the quality and integrity of the data, are promptly identified and addressed. |
