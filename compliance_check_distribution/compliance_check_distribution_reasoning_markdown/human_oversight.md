| Task Name | Compliance Check | Reasoning |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Bias and Fairness Testing | Bias Detection & Mitigation | This task directly supports the principle of human oversight by ensuring that the AI system does not perpetuate harmful biases or unfairness. It involves human intervention in the design cycle of the system to monitor and correct any biases in the AI's decision-making process, aligning with the human-on-the-loop (HOTL) approach. |
| Interpretability Analysis | Model Explainability Implementation | Interpretability analysis is crucial for human oversight as it provides transparency into the AI's decision-making process. This enables human overseers to understand, validate, and potentially challenge the AI's decisions, aligning with the human-in-command (HIC) approach. |
| Performance Metric Calculation | Evaluation Metric Computation | Performance metrics provide quantitative measures of the AI system's performance, which human overseers can use to monitor and evaluate the system's operation. This supports the HOTL approach by enabling human intervention during the system's operation cycle. |
| Error Analysis | Incorrect Prediction Analysis | Error analysis is a form of human oversight that involves examining the AI system's incorrect predictions. This allows human overseers to understand the system's limitations and potential areas for improvement, supporting the HITL, HOTL, and HIC approaches. |
| Model Validation | Validation Set Performance Check | Model validation involves human overseers checking the AI system's performance against a validation set. This supports the principle of human oversight by ensuring that the system's decisions are accurate and reliable, aligning with the HITL and HOTL approaches. |
| Performance Monitoring | Model Performance Metric Tracking | Performance monitoring allows human overseers to continuously track the AI system's performance metrics. This supports the HOTL approach by enabling human intervention during the system's operation cycle based on these metrics. |
| Data Drift Detection | Input Data Distribution Monitoring | Data drift detection involves monitoring changes in the input data distribution. This supports human oversight by alerting human overseers to potential issues that may affect the AI system's performance or decision-making, supporting the HOTL approach. |
| Incident Response Planning | Model Failure & Security Handling | Incident response planning is a form of human oversight that prepares for potential failures or security issues in the AI system. This supports the HIC approach by ensuring that humans have the ability to intervene and take appropriate action in such situations. |
