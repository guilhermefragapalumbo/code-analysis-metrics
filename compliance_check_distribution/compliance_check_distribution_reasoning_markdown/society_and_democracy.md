| Task Name | Compliance Check | Reasoning |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Bias and Fairness Testing | Bias Detection & Mitigation | This task directly supports the principle of society and democracy as it ensures that the AI system does not favor or discriminate against any particular group. This is crucial in democratic contexts where fairness and equality are paramount. By detecting and mitigating bias, we can ensure that the AI system's impact on society and institutions is positive and fair. |
| Interpretability Analysis | Model Explainability Implementation | Interpretability in AI systems is key to ensuring transparency and trust, which are foundational to democratic processes and institutions. If the workings of an AI system are understandable, it can be scrutinized, evaluated, and held accountable by society, thereby supporting democratic principles. |
| Anonymization and Privacy Handling | Sensitive Data Masking | Privacy is a fundamental right in democratic societies. Therefore, handling data in a way that respects privacy and anonymizes sensitive information is essential. This task aligns with the principle of society and democracy as it ensures that the use of AI systems does not infringe on individuals' privacy rights, thereby maintaining trust in institutions and society. |
| Security Measures | Authentication & Encryption Checks | Security measures are crucial to protect the integrity of democratic processes and institutions. Ensuring that AI systems are secure and resistant to manipulation or misuse helps maintain public trust and confidence in these systems and their societal impact. |
| Incident Response Planning | Model Failure & Security Handling | Planning for incidents and potential failures in AI systems is necessary to mitigate their impact on society and democracy. A well-prepared incident response can prevent or limit damage, ensuring the stability and reliability of AI systems, which is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in democratic processes and institutions. |
| Data Drift Detection | Input Data Distribution Monitoring | Monitoring for data drift ensures that the AI system continues to perform as expected as the input data changes over time. This is crucial in a societal and democratic context as it ensures that the AI system remains relevant and accurate, thereby maintaining its positive impact on society and democratic processes. |
| Concept Drift Detection | Target Relationship Change Detection | Detecting concept drift is important to ensure that the AI system adapts to changes in the underlying relationships in the data. This is crucial in a societal and democratic context as it ensures that the AI system remains relevant and accurate, thereby maintaining its positive impact on society and democratic processes. |
