| Data Collection | Raw Data Acquisition | Traceability in AI systems begins with the data collection process. By documenting the sources and methods of raw data acquisition, we can trace back the origins of the data used in the AI system. This supports the principle of traceability by providing a clear record of the initial data gathering process. |
| Data Labeling | Annotation Mechanism | Data labeling is a crucial step in the development of AI systems, particularly for supervised learning models. The annotation mechanism used for labeling should be documented to ensure traceability. This allows for an understanding of how and why certain data was labeled in a particular way, contributing to the transparency and auditability of the AI system. |
| Metadata Management | Metadata Storage and Tracking | Metadata provides context for the data used in AI systems. By storing and tracking metadata, we can trace the lineage of data and understand its attributes. This supports the principle of traceability by providing a clear record of the data's characteristics and transformations over time. |
| Data Versioning | Version Control Implementation | Data versioning involves keeping track of different versions of datasets used in the AI system. This allows for traceability of data changes over time and can help identify when and why certain changes were made. This supports the principle of traceability by providing a clear record of the data's evolution. |
| Model Training | Training Process Implementation | The model training process should be documented to ensure traceability. This includes the algorithms used, the training data, and the configuration of the model. This supports the principle of traceability by providing a clear record of how the model was trained and the decisions made during this process. |
| Model Serialization | Deployable Model Format Check | Model serialization involves converting the trained model into a format that can be stored and used later. Documenting this process allows for traceability of the model's state at different points in time. This supports the principle of traceability by providing a clear record of the model's development and deployment stages. |
| Experiment Tracking | Hyperparameter & Metric Logging | Experiment tracking involves logging the hyperparameters used and the performance metrics achieved during model training. This allows for traceability of the model's performance over time and can help identify when and why certain changes were made. This supports the principle of traceability by providing a clear record of the model's performance evolution. |
| Model Registry Management | Version-Controlled Model Storage | Model registry management involves storing different versions of the model in a version-controlled manner. This allows for traceability of model changes over time and can help identify when and why certain changes were made. This supports the principle of traceability by providing a clear record of the model's evolution. |
| Logging and Debugging | Prediction & Failure Logging | Logging and debugging involve recording the AI system's predictions and failures. This allows for traceability of the system's output and can help identify when and why certain errors occurred. This supports the principle of traceability by providing a clear record of the system's operation and performance. |
