    "Task Name": "Data Collection",
    "Compliance Check": "Raw Data Acquisition",
    "Reasoning": "The process of raw data acquisition is directly related to the principle of access to data as it involves the initial stage of data access. Ensuring ethical alignment at this stage is crucial as it sets the tone for subsequent data handling processes. The access to data should be limited to qualified personnel, and data acquisition should be conducted in a manner that respects the rights and privacy of individuals."

  {
    "Task Name": "Data Extraction",
    "Compliance Check": "Data Retrieval Implementation",
    "Reasoning": "Data retrieval is a process that involves accessing stored data. Implementing ethical guidelines in this process ensures that only authorized personnel can access the data, thereby aligning with the principle of access to data."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Data Integration",
    "Compliance Check": "Multi-Source Data Merging",
    "Reasoning": "The process of merging data from multiple sources involves accessing data from different locations. Implementing ethical guidelines in this process ensures that the access to data from different sources is controlled and limited to authorized personnel."

  {
    "Task Name": "Security Measures",
    "Compliance Check": "Authentication & Encryption Checks",
    "Reasoning": "Authentication and encryption checks are crucial for controlling access to data. Authentication ensures that only authorized personnel can access the data, while encryption protects the data from unauthorized access during transmission. Both of these checks align with the principle of access to data."
