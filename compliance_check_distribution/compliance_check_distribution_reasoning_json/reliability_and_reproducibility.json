  {
    "Task Name": "Data Versioning",
    "Compliance Check": "Version Control Implementation",
    "Reasoning": "Data versioning directly supports the principle of reliability and reproducibility. By keeping track of different versions of data, it ensures that the AI system can be tested and validated under the same conditions, thus ensuring reproducibility. It also contributes to reliability by allowing developers to revert to a previous version if a new one introduces errors or issues."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Schema Validation",
    "Compliance Check": "Schema Conformance Check",
    "Reasoning": "Schema validation ensures that the data used in AI systems is consistent and adheres to a predefined structure. This contributes to reliability by reducing the risk of errors caused by unexpected or malformed data. It also supports reproducibility by ensuring that the data structure remains consistent across different runs of the AI system."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)",
    "Compliance Check": "Automated Deployment Pipeline",
    "Reasoning": "CI/CD practices ensure that the AI system is consistently tested and deployed in a controlled manner. This contributes to reliability by catching and addressing issues early and regularly. It also supports reproducibility by maintaining a consistent deployment environment and process."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Performance Metric Calculation",
    "Compliance Check": "Evaluation Metric Computation",
    "Reasoning": "Calculating performance metrics allows for the evaluation of the AI system's performance under different conditions. This is crucial for ensuring reliability, as it allows for the identification and rectification of performance issues. It also supports reproducibility by providing a quantifiable measure of the system's behavior that can be compared across different runs."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Model Validation",
    "Compliance Check": "Validation Set Performance Check",
    "Reasoning": "Model validation ensures that the AI system performs well on unseen data, contributing to its reliability. It also supports reproducibility by providing a consistent set of criteria for evaluating the system's performance."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Experiment Tracking",
    "Compliance Check": "Hyperparameter & Metric Logging",
    "Reasoning": "Experiment tracking allows for the logging and reviewing of different configurations and outcomes of the AI system. This directly supports reproducibility by providing a record of the conditions under which the system was run. It also contributes to reliability by allowing developers to identify and revert to configurations that yielded the best results."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Model Registry Management",
    "Compliance Check": "Version-Controlled Model Storage",
    "Reasoning": "Model registry management ensures that different versions of the AI model are properly tracked and stored. This supports reproducibility by allowing the same version of the model to be used in different runs of the system. It also contributes to reliability by allowing developers to revert to a previous model version if a new one introduces issues."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Performance Monitoring",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Performance Metric Tracking",
    "Reasoning": "Performance monitoring allows for the regular assessment of the AI system's performance. This contributes to reliability by ensuring that any performance issues are promptly identified and addressed. It also supports reproducibility by providing a consistent measure of the system's performance over time."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Data Drift Detection",
    "Compliance Check": "Input Data Distribution Monitoring",
    "Reasoning": "Data drift detection monitors changes in the input data over time. This supports reliability by ensuring that the AI system continues to perform well even as the data changes. It also contributes to reproducibility by providing a record of the data conditions under which the system was tested."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Logging and Debugging",
    "Compliance Check": "Prediction & Failure Logging",
    "Reasoning": "Logging and debugging practices provide a record of the AI system's predictions and failures. This directly supports reproducibility by allowing developers to review the system's behavior under specific conditions. It also contributes to reliability by providing a means to identify and address issues that cause the system to fail or make incorrect predictions."
