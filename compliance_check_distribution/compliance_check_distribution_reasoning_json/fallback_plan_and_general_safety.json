  {
    "Task Name": "Infrastructure Setup",
    "Compliance Check": "Deployment Platform Selection",
    "Reasoning": "Selecting an appropriate deployment platform is crucial for ensuring the safety of an AI system. The platform must be robust and reliable to support a fallback plan in case of system failure, and to minimize unintended consequences and errors."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Containerization",
    "Compliance Check": "Containerized Model Deployment",
    "Reasoning": "Containerization allows for the isolation of the AI system, which can be crucial for safety. If a problem arises, it can be contained within the isolated environment, preventing it from affecting other systems and enabling a safe fallback plan."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Scalability Planning",
    "Compliance Check": "Load Balancing & Autoscaling",
    "Reasoning": "Planning for scalability, including load balancing and autoscaling, is essential for the safety of an AI system. This ensures that the system can handle increased loads without failing, thereby reducing the risk of unintended consequences and enabling a fallback plan."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Security Measures",
    "Compliance Check": "Authentication & Encryption Checks",
    "Reasoning": "Security measures such as authentication and encryption checks are crucial for the safety of an AI system. They protect the system from unauthorized access and data breaches, thereby reducing the risk of harm to living beings or the environment."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)",
    "Compliance Check": "Automated Deployment Pipeline",
    "Reasoning": "CI/CD practices, including automated deployment pipelines, are essential for the safety of an AI system. They allow for continuous testing and deployment of updates, ensuring that any issues are quickly identified and resolved, and that a fallback plan can be implemented if necessary."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Error Analysis",
    "Compliance Check": "Incorrect Prediction Analysis",
    "Reasoning": "Analyzing incorrect predictions is a key aspect of ensuring the safety of an AI system. It helps identify potential issues that could lead to harmful outcomes or unintended consequences, and enables the implementation of a fallback plan if necessary."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Bias and Fairness Testing",
    "Compliance Check": "Bias Detection & Mitigation",
    "Reasoning": "Bias and fairness testing is crucial for the safety of an AI system. Biased outcomes can lead to harm to individuals or groups, so detecting and mitigating bias helps to minimize these risks and ensure the system behaves as intended."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Performance Monitoring",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Performance Metric Tracking",
    "Reasoning": "Monitoring the performance of an AI system is essential for safety. It allows for the early detection of issues that could lead to unintended consequences or harm, and enables the implementation of a fallback plan if necessary."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Data Drift Detection",
    "Compliance Check": "Input Data Distribution Monitoring",
    "Reasoning": "Detecting data drift is crucial for the safety of an AI system. Changes in the distribution of input data can lead to incorrect predictions and unintended consequences, so monitoring this helps to minimize these risks and ensure the system behaves as intended."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Incident Response Planning",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Failure & Security Handling",
    "Reasoning": "Planning for incident response is essential for the safety of an AI system. It ensures that there is a plan in place to handle system failures or security incidents, thereby reducing the risk of harm and enabling a fallback plan."
