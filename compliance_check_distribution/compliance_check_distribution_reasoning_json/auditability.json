  {
    "Task Name": "Performance Metric Calculation",
    "Compliance Check": "Evaluation Metric Computation",
    "Reasoning": "The calculation of performance metrics allows auditors to assess the effectiveness and accuracy of the AI system. This is crucial for auditability as it provides a quantitative measure of the system's performance."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Bias and Fairness Testing",
    "Compliance Check": "Bias Detection & Mitigation",
    "Reasoning": "Bias and fairness testing is crucial for auditability as it allows auditors to assess whether the AI system is treating all individuals and groups fairly. This is key for ensuring that the system is not perpetuating or exacerbating existing biases."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Interpretability Analysis",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Explainability Implementation",
    "Reasoning": "Interpretability analysis is key for auditability as it allows auditors to understand how the AI system makes its decisions. This is crucial for assessing the fairness and reliability of the system, and for identifying any potential issues or biases."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Model Validation",
    "Compliance Check": "Validation Set Performance Check",
    "Reasoning": "Model validation is important for auditability as it allows auditors to assess how well the AI system generalizes to unseen data. This is crucial for understanding the system's robustness and reliability."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Experiment Tracking",
    "Compliance Check": "Hyperparameter & Metric Logging",
    "Reasoning": "Experiment tracking supports auditability by providing a record of the different configurations and performance metrics of the AI system. This allows auditors to understand how the system has been optimized and to assess the robustness of the optimization process."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Model Registry Management",
    "Compliance Check": "Version-Controlled Model Storage",
    "Reasoning": "Model registry management supports auditability by providing a record of the different versions of the AI model. This allows auditors to understand how the model has evolved over time and to assess the impact of different versions on the system's performance."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Performance Monitoring",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Performance Metric Tracking",
    "Reasoning": "Performance monitoring is key for auditability as it provides a continuous record of the AI system's performance. This allows auditors to assess the system's reliability and stability over time."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Data Drift Detection",
    "Compliance Check": "Input Data Distribution Monitoring",
    "Reasoning": "Data drift detection supports auditability by monitoring changes in the distribution of the input data. This allows auditors to understand how changes in the data may have affected the AI system's performance."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Logging and Debugging",
    "Compliance Check": "Prediction & Failure Logging",
    "Reasoning": "Logging and debugging are crucial for auditability as they provide a record of the AI system's predictions and failures. This allows auditors to understand the system's behavior and to identify any potential issues or errors."
