    "Task Name": "Bias and Fairness Testing",
    "Compliance Check": "Bias Detection & Mitigation",
    "Reasoning": "This task directly supports the ethical principle of minimising and reporting negative impacts. By detecting and mitigating bias in the AI system, we can prevent unfair or discriminatory outcomes, which are negative impacts. Furthermore, the process of testing for bias and fairness inherently involves reporting on these issues, aligning with the principle's emphasis on transparency and accountability."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Error Analysis",
    "Compliance Check": "Incorrect Prediction Analysis",
    "Reasoning": "Error analysis is crucial in identifying and reporting on the negative impacts of an AI system. By analysing incorrect predictions, we can understand where the system is failing and potentially causing harm. This process allows for the minimisation of these negative impacts through iterative improvements and adjustments."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Incident Response Planning",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Failure & Security Handling",
    "Reasoning": "Incident response planning directly supports the principle of minimising and reporting negative impacts. It ensures that when a system failure or security breach occurs, there is a plan in place to mitigate the damage and report the incident. This aligns with the principle's emphasis on accountability and harm reduction."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Anomaly Detection",
    "Compliance Check": "Unexpected Prediction Flagging",
    "Reasoning": "Anomaly detection is a key task in minimising and reporting negative impacts. By flagging unexpected predictions, we can identify potential issues or failures in the AI system. This allows for timely intervention to minimise harm and provides a mechanism for reporting on these issues."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Performance Monitoring",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Performance Metric Tracking",
    "Reasoning": "Performance monitoring is essential in minimising and reporting negative impacts. By tracking model performance metrics, we can identify when the system is not performing as expected and potentially causing negative impacts. This task provides a mechanism for both minimising harm through performance optimisation and reporting on system performance."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Data Drift Detection",
    "Compliance Check": "Input Data Distribution Monitoring",
    "Reasoning": "Data drift detection supports the principle of minimising and reporting negative impacts by monitoring changes in the input data distribution. If the data drifts significantly, it could lead to incorrect predictions and negative impacts. By detecting this drift, we can take corrective action and report on the issue."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Concept Drift Detection",
    "Compliance Check": "Target Relationship Change Detection",
    "Reasoning": "Concept drift detection is crucial in minimising and reporting negative impacts. By detecting changes in the relationship between input data and target variables, we can identify potential issues that could lead to incorrect predictions and negative impacts. This task provides a mechanism for both minimising harm and reporting on these issues."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Logging and Debugging",
    "Compliance Check": "Prediction & Failure Logging",
    "Reasoning": "Logging and debugging directly support the principle of minimising and reporting negative impacts. By logging predictions and system failures, we can identify and report on issues that could lead to negative impacts. Furthermore, debugging allows for the minimisation of these impacts through iterative system improvements."
