  {
    "Task Name": "Interpretability Analysis",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Explainability Implementation",
    "Reasoning": "This task directly supports the principle of explainability as it involves implementing methods to make the AI model's decisions understandable and traceable by human beings. It allows stakeholders to comprehend how the model works and how it makes its decisions, thereby enhancing transparency and trust in the AI system."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Explainability Features",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Interpretability Tools",
    "Reasoning": "Incorporating explainability features into an AI system is a direct operationalization of the explainability principle. These features provide insights into the model's decision-making process, making it understandable to various stakeholders, from laypersons to researchers. This task also helps in managing the trade-off between model accuracy and explainability."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Error Analysis",
    "Compliance Check": "Incorrect Prediction Analysis",
    "Reasoning": "Error analysis contributes to explainability by identifying and explaining the reasons behind incorrect predictions made by the AI system. This understanding can help stakeholders trace the decision-making process of the AI system and improve its transparency."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Bias and Fairness Testing",
    "Compliance Check": "Bias Detection & Mitigation",
    "Reasoning": "While not directly related to explainability, bias and fairness testing can indirectly support this principle by revealing biases in the AI system's decisions. Understanding these biases can provide insights into the system's decision-making process, thereby contributing to its explainability."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Performance Metric Calculation",
    "Compliance Check": "Evaluation Metric Computation",
    "Reasoning": "Performance metrics provide quantifiable measures of an AI system's performance, which can be used to explain how well the system is working. This can help stakeholders understand the system's capabilities and limitations, thereby supporting the principle of explainability."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Uncertainty Estimation",
    "Compliance Check": "Confidence & Uncertainty Measures",
    "Reasoning": "Uncertainty estimation can enhance explainability by providing measures of the AI system's confidence in its decisions. This can help stakeholders understand the reliability of the system's decisions and the degree of certainty or uncertainty associated with them."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Logging and Debugging",
    "Compliance Check": "Prediction & Failure Logging",
    "Reasoning": "Logging and debugging can support explainability by recording the AI system's predictions and failures. This can provide insights into the system's decision-making process and help stakeholders understand why certain decisions were made or why certain failures occurred."
