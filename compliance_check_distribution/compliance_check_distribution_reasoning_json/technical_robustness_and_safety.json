    "Task Name": "Data Quality Checks",
    "Compliance Check": "Consistency and Integrity Checks",
    "Reasoning": "Ensuring the quality of data used in AI systems is key to technical robustness and safety. Consistency and integrity checks help to prevent errors and inaccuracies in the data, which can lead to unintended and harmful outcomes when the AI system is deployed."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Infrastructure Setup",
    "Compliance Check": "Deployment Platform Selection",
    "Reasoning": "Choosing a suitable deployment platform is crucial for the robustness of an AI system. The platform needs to be reliable and secure to prevent any harm that could result from technical failures or security breaches."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Security Measures",
    "Compliance Check": "Authentication & Encryption Checks",
    "Reasoning": "Implementing strong security measures, such as authentication and encryption, is essential for the safety of AI systems. These measures protect the system from adversarial attacks and data breaches, which could lead to harmful outcomes."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Performance Metric Calculation",
    "Compliance Check": "Evaluation Metric Computation",
    "Reasoning": "Calculating performance metrics allows for the assessment of an AI system's robustness. By evaluating these metrics, developers can ensure that the system is performing as intended and identify any potential issues that could lead to harm."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Error Analysis",
    "Compliance Check": "Incorrect Prediction Analysis",
    "Reasoning": "Analysing errors made by the AI system is crucial for ensuring its robustness and safety. By understanding the types of errors the system makes, developers can make necessary adjustments to prevent these errors from causing harm in real-world applications."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Bias and Fairness Testing",
    "Compliance Check": "Bias Detection & Mitigation",
    "Reasoning": "Bias in AI systems can lead to unfair and potentially harmful outcomes. By testing for bias and implementing mitigation strategies, developers can ensure that the system is fair and does not cause harm due to biased decisions or recommendations."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Model Validation",
    "Compliance Check": "Validation Set Performance Check",
    "Reasoning": "Validating the performance of the AI model on a separate set of data helps to ensure its robustness and safety. This process can identify potential issues that may not have been evident during training, preventing unexpected and harmful outcomes when the model is deployed."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Defining Loss Functions and Optimizers",
    "Compliance Check": "Loss Function & Optimizer Selection",
    "Reasoning": "The selection of appropriate loss functions and optimizers is crucial for the robustness of an AI system. These elements determine how the system learns and adapts, and inappropriate choices can lead to poor performance and potentially harmful outcomes."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Performance Monitoring",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Performance Metric Tracking",
    "Reasoning": "Monitoring the performance of an AI system over time is key to ensuring its robustness and safety. This process allows developers to detect and address any declines in performance or other issues that could lead to harmful outcomes."
  },
  {
    "Task Name": "Incident Response Planning",
    "Compliance Check": "Model Failure & Security Handling",
    "Reasoning": "Planning for incidents, including model failures and security breaches, is crucial for the safety of AI systems. Having a plan in place allows for quick and effective responses to such incidents, minimizing any potential harm."
