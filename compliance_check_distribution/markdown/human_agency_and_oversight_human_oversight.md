| Bias and Fairness Testing      | Bias Detection & Mitigation         | Assess whether the code includes techniques to detect and mitigate model biases against specific groups.                                   |
| Interpretability Analysis      | Model Explainability Implementation | Verify if the code uses SHAP, LIME, or feature importance scores to explain model predictions.                                             |
| Performance Metric Calculation | Evaluation Metric Computation       | Check if the code computes relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, or RMSE, MAE for regression. |
| Error Analysis                 | Incorrect Prediction Analysis       | Check if the code identifies patterns in incorrect predictions and provides insights for improvement.                                      |
| Model Validation               | Validation Set Performance Check    | Check if the code evaluates the modelâ€™s generalization ability using a validation set.                                                     |
| Performance Monitoring         | Model Performance Metric Tracking   | Verify if the code logs key metrics like accuracy, latency, and throughput in production.                                                  |
| Data Drift Detection           | Input Data Distribution Monitoring  | Check if the code includes mechanisms to track shifts in input data distribution.                                                          |
| Incident Response Planning     | Model Failure & Security Handling   | Verify if the code includes strategies for handling failures, security threats, or biases.                                                 |
