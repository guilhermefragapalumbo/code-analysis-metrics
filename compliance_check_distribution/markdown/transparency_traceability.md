| Data Collection           | Raw Data Acquisition             | Check if the code includes methods to collect raw data from databases, APIs, sensors, web scraping, or user inputs.           |
| Data Labeling             | Annotation Mechanism             | Assess if the code includes an annotation system for supervised learning tasks, such as manual or automated labeling.         |
| Metadata Management       | Metadata Storage and Tracking    | Verify if the code maintains structured metadata, including source details, timestamps, and schema definitions.               |
| Data Versioning           | Version Control Implementation   | Ensure that the code implements dataset versioning to track different versions for reproducibility and rollback capabilities. |
| Model Training            | Training Process Implementation  | Assess if the code includes proper logic to train the selected model on the dataset.                                          |
| Model Serialization       | Deployable Model Format Check    | Verify if the code serializes the trained model into a deployable format (e.g., Pickle, ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel).         |
| Experiment Tracking       | Hyperparameter & Metric Logging  | Check if the code logs hyperparameters, metrics, and model configurations for reproducibility.                                |
| Model Registry Management | Version-Controlled Model Storage | Verify if the code stores models in a registry like MLflow or ModelDB for version control.                                    |
| Logging and Debugging     | Prediction & Failure Logging     | Ensure the code maintains logs of predictions, failures, and user feedback for debugging.                                     |
