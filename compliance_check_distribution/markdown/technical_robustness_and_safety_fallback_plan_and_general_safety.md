| Infrastructure Setup                                 | Deployment Platform Selection      | Verify if the code specifies the deployment platform (on-premises, cloud, or edge devices).              |
| Containerization                                     | Containerized Model Deployment     | Check if the code includes Docker or Kubernetes for deploying the model in a containerized environment.  |
| Scalability Planning                                 | Load Balancing & Autoscaling       | Check if the code includes autoscaling or load balancing to handle high-demand scenarios.                |
| Security Measures                                    | Authentication & Encryption Checks | Ensure the code implements authentication, authorization, and encryption for model security.             |
| Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) | Automated Deployment Pipeline      | Ensure the code includes CI/CD mechanisms to automate model deployment and updates.                      |
| Error Analysis                                       | Incorrect Prediction Analysis      | Check if the code identifies patterns in incorrect predictions and provides insights for improvement.    |
| Bias and Fairness Testing                            | Bias Detection & Mitigation        | Assess whether the code includes techniques to detect and mitigate model biases against specific groups. |
| Performance Monitoring                               | Model Performance Metric Tracking  | Verify if the code logs key metrics like accuracy, latency, and throughput in production.                |
| Data Drift Detection                                 | Input Data Distribution Monitoring | Check if the code includes mechanisms to track shifts in input data distribution.                        |
| Incident Response Planning                           | Model Failure & Security Handling  | Verify if the code includes strategies for handling failures, security threats, or biases.               |
