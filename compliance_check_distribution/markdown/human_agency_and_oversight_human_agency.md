| Bias and Fairness Testing   | Bias Detection & Mitigation         | Assess whether the code includes techniques to detect and mitigate model biases against specific groups.  |
| Interpretability Analysis   | Model Explainability Implementation | Verify if the code uses SHAP, LIME, or feature importance scores to explain model predictions.            |
| Anomaly Detection           | Unexpected Prediction Flagging      | Check if the code includes mechanisms to detect and flag unexpected predictions.                          |
| Incident Response Planning  | Model Failure & Security Handling   | Verify if the code includes strategies for handling failures, security threats, or biases.                |
| Explainability Features     | Model Interpretability Tools        | Check if the code incorporates tools like SHAP, LIME, or attention mechanisms to explain model decisions. |
| Model Retraining Scheduling | Automated Model Retraining Pipeline | Verify if the code automates retraining based on performance decay or data updates.                       |
| Logging and Debugging       | Prediction & Failure Logging        | Ensure the code maintains logs of predictions, failures, and user feedback for debugging.                 |
