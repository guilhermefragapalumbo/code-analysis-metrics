| Data Quality Checks                    | Consistency and Integrity Checks    | Assess whether the code includes checks to maintain data quality and consistency throughout preprocessing.                                 |
| Infrastructure Setup                   | Deployment Platform Selection       | Verify if the code specifies the deployment platform (on-premises, cloud, or edge devices).                                                |
| Security Measures                      | Authentication & Encryption Checks  | Ensure the code implements authentication, authorization, and encryption for model security.                                               |
| Performance Metric Calculation         | Evaluation Metric Computation       | Check if the code computes relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, or RMSE, MAE for regression. |
| Error Analysis                         | Incorrect Prediction Analysis       | Check if the code identifies patterns in incorrect predictions and provides insights for improvement.                                      |
| Bias and Fairness Testing              | Bias Detection & Mitigation         | Assess whether the code includes techniques to detect and mitigate model biases against specific groups.                                   |
| Model Validation                       | Validation Set Performance Check    | Check if the code evaluates the modelâ€™s generalization ability using a validation set.                                                     |
| Defining Loss Functions and Optimizers | Loss Function & Optimizer Selection | Verify if the code properly defines loss functions (e.g., MSE, cross-entropy) and optimization methods (SGD, Adam).                        |
| Performance Monitoring                 | Model Performance Metric Tracking   | Verify if the code logs key metrics like accuracy, latency, and throughput in production.                                                  |
| Incident Response Planning             | Model Failure & Security Handling   | Verify if the code includes strategies for handling failures, security threats, or biases.                                                 |
