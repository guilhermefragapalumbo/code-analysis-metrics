| Data Collection                    | Raw Data Acquisition                 | Check if the code includes methods to collect raw data from databases, APIs, sensors, web scraping, or user inputs.                              |
| Data Extraction                    | Data Retrieval Implementation        | Verify if the code includes logic to extract data from structured (CSV, SQL databases) and unstructured (PDFs, images, text) sources.            |
| Data Integration                   | Multi-Source Data Merging            | Assess whether the code includes functionality to merge multiple data sources while resolving inconsistencies.                                   |
| Data Storage Strategy              | Storage Selection and Implementation | Evaluate whether the code correctly implements storage solutions, such as data lakes, warehouses, or distributed systems, based on requirements. |
| Anonymization and Privacy Handling | Sensitive Data Masking               | Check if the code masks or anonymizes sensitive data while preserving analytical utility.                                                        |
| Security Measures                  | Authentication & Encryption Checks   | Ensure the code implements authentication, authorization, and encryption for model security.                                                     |
| Incident Response Planning         | Model Failure & Security Handling    | Verify if the code includes strategies for handling failures, security threats, or biases.                                                       |
