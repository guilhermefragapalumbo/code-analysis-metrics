| Bias and Fairness Testing | Bias Detection & Mitigation         | Assess whether the code includes techniques to detect and mitigate model biases against specific groups.  |
| Interpretability Analysis | Model Explainability Implementation | Verify if the code uses SHAP, LIME, or feature importance scores to explain model predictions.            |
| Explainability Features   | Model Interpretability Tools        | Check if the code incorporates tools like SHAP, LIME, or attention mechanisms to explain model decisions. |
| Uncertainty Estimation    | Confidence & Uncertainty Measures   | Verify if the code includes methods such as Bayesian inference or dropout-based uncertainty estimation.   |
| Anomaly Detection         | Unexpected Prediction Flagging      | Check if the code includes mechanisms to detect and flag unexpected predictions.                          |
| Logging and Debugging     | Prediction & Failure Logging        | Ensure the code maintains logs of predictions, failures, and user feedback for debugging.                 |
