| Task Name                          | Compliance Check                     | Compliance description                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection                    | Raw Data Acquisition                 | Check if the code includes methods to collect raw data from databases, APIs, sensors, web scraping, or user inputs.                              |
| Data Extraction                    | Data Retrieval Implementation        | Verify if the code includes logic to extract data from structured (CSV, SQL databases) and unstructured (PDFs, images, text) sources.            |
| Data Integration                   | Multi-Source Data Merging            | Assess whether the code includes functionality to merge multiple data sources while resolving inconsistencies.                                   |
| Metadata Management                | Metadata Storage and Tracking        | Verify if the code maintains structured metadata, including source details, timestamps, and schema definitions.                                  |
| Data Versioning                    | Version Control Implementation       | Ensure that the code implements dataset versioning to track different versions for reproducibility and rollback capabilities.                    |
| Data Storage Strategy              | Storage Selection and Implementation | Evaluate whether the code correctly implements storage solutions, such as data lakes, warehouses, or distributed systems, based on requirements. |
| Anonymization and Privacy Handling | Sensitive Data Masking               | Check if the code masks or anonymizes sensitive data while preserving analytical utility.                                                        |
| Data Quality Checks                | Consistency and Integrity Checks     | Assess whether the code includes checks to maintain data quality and consistency throughout preprocessing.                                       |
| Security Measures                  | Authentication & Encryption Checks   | Ensure the code implements authentication, authorization, and encryption for model security.                                                     |
| Data Drift Detection               | Input Data Distribution Monitoring   | Check if the code includes mechanisms to track shifts in input data distribution.                                                                |
| Logging and Debugging              | Prediction & Failure Logging         | Ensure the code maintains logs of predictions, failures, and user feedback for debugging.                                                        |
