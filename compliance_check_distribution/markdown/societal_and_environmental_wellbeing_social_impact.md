| Bias and Fairness Testing  | Bias Detection & Mitigation          | Assess whether the code includes techniques to detect and mitigate model biases against specific groups. |
| Interpretability Analysis  | Model Explainability Implementation  | Verify if the code uses SHAP, LIME, or feature importance scores to explain model predictions.           |
| Anomaly Detection          | Unexpected Prediction Flagging       | Check if the code includes mechanisms to detect and flag unexpected predictions.                         |
| Data Drift Detection       | Input Data Distribution Monitoring   | Check if the code includes mechanisms to track shifts in input data distribution.                        |
| Concept Drift Detection    | Target Relationship Change Detection | Ensure the code monitors changes in the relationship between input features and target labels.           |
| Incident Response Planning | Model Failure & Security Handling    | Verify if the code includes strategies for handling failures, security threats, or biases.               |
| Performance Monitoring     | Model Performance Metric Tracking    | Verify if the code logs key metrics like accuracy, latency, and throughput in production.                |
