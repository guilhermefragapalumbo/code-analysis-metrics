| Task Name | Compliance Check | Compliance Description |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Metadata Management | Metadata Storage and Tracking | Verify if the code maintains structured metadata, including source details, timestamps, and schema definitions. |
| Data Versioning | Version Control Implementation | Ensure that the code implements dataset versioning to track different versions for reproducibility and rollback capabilities. |
| Schema Validation | Schema Conformance Check | Check if the code validates incoming data against predefined formats and structures to ensure compliance. |
| Data Quality Checks | Consistency and Integrity Checks | Assess whether the code includes checks to maintain data quality and consistency throughout preprocessing. |
| Performance Metric Calculation | Evaluation Metric Computation | Check if the code computes relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, or RMSE, MAE for regression. |
| Bias and Fairness Testing | Bias Detection & Mitigation | Assess whether the code includes techniques to detect and mitigate model biases against specific groups. |
| Interpretability Analysis | Model Explainability Implementation | Verify if the code uses SHAP, LIME, or feature importance scores to explain model predictions. |
| Model Validation | Validation Set Performance Check | Check if the code evaluates the modelâ€™s generalization ability using a validation set. |
| Experiment Tracking | Hyperparameter & Metric Logging | Check if the code logs hyperparameters, metrics, and model configurations for reproducibility. |
| Model Registry Management | Version-Controlled Model Storage | Verify if the code stores models in a registry like MLflow or ModelDB for version control. |
| Performance Monitoring | Model Performance Metric Tracking | Verify if the code logs key metrics like accuracy, latency, and throughput in production. |
| Data Drift Detection | Input Data Distribution Monitoring | Check if the code includes mechanisms to track shifts in input data distribution. |
| Logging and Debugging | Prediction & Failure Logging | Ensure the code maintains logs of predictions, failures, and user feedback for debugging. |
