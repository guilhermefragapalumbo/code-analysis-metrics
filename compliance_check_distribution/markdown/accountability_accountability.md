| Task Name | Compliance Check | Compliance Description |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Experiment Tracking | Hyperparameter & Metric Logging | Check if the code logs hyperparameters, metrics, and model configurations for reproducibility. |
| Model Registry Management | Version-Controlled Model Storage | Verify if the code stores models in a registry like MLflow or ModelDB for version control. |
| Performance Monitoring | Model Performance Metric Tracking | Verify if the code logs key metrics like accuracy, latency, and throughput in production. |
| Data Drift Detection | Input Data Distribution Monitoring | Check if the code includes mechanisms to track shifts in input data distribution. |
| Incident Response Planning | Model Failure & Security Handling | Verify if the code includes strategies for handling failures, security threats, or biases. |
| Logging and Debugging | Prediction & Failure Logging | Ensure the code maintains logs of predictions, failures, and user feedback for debugging. |
| Bias and Fairness Testing | Bias Detection & Mitigation | Assess whether the code includes techniques to detect and mitigate model biases against specific groups. |
| Interpretability Analysis | Model Explainability Implementation | Verify if the code uses SHAP, LIME, or feature importance scores to explain model predictions. |
