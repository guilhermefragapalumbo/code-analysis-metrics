# Towards Measurable Ethics: A Framework for AI Ethical Compliance Metrics
### by Guilherme Palumbo

The methodology consists of five sequential stages: (1) AI Lifecycle Stage Identification, (2) Tasks Definition, (3) Compliance List Development, (4) Compliance Checks Distribution, and (5) Metrics Creation. 
Each stage builds upon the previous one to form a comprehensive architecture capable of producing objective, interpretable, and quantifiable metrics grounded in ethical principles, grounded in both AI development best practices and the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI.

## (2) Tasks Definition

| Task Name | Description | Stage |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Data Collection | Gather raw data from databases, APIs, sensors, web scraping, user inputs, or other sources. | Data Ingestion & Versioning |
| Data Extraction | Retrieve data from structured (CSV, SQL) and unstructured (PDFs, images, text) sources. | Data Ingestion & Versioning |
| Data Integration | Merge data from multiple sources while resolving inconsistencies. | Data Ingestion & Versioning |
| Streaming Data Handling | Manage real-time ingestion from IoT devices, event-driven systems, or streaming platforms. | Data Ingestion & Versioning |
| Batch Data Handling | Process large amounts of data in scheduled or on-demand batches. | Data Ingestion & Versioning |

## (3) Compliance List Development

| Task Name | Compliance Check | Compliance Description |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Data Collection | Raw Data Acquisition | Check if the code includes methods to collect raw data from databases, APIs, sensors, web scraping, or user inputs. |
| Data Extraction | Data Retrieval Implementation | Verify if the code includes logic to extract data from structured (CSV, SQL databases) and unstructured (PDFs, images, text) sources. |
| Data Integration | Multi-Source Data Merging | Assess whether the code includes functionality to merge multiple data sources while resolving inconsistencies. |
| Streaming Data Handling | Real-Time Data Ingestion | Determine if the code implements handling of real-time data streams from IoT devices, event-driven systems, or streaming platforms. |
| Batch Data Handling | Batch Processing Implementation | Check if the code supports batch processing mechanisms for large-scale data ingestion. |

## (4) Compliance Checks Distribution
